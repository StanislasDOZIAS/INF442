## If you are on a LINUX OS, please do the following steps :

make scripts
make
./inf422
```
You can access to the documentation with `make doc`

## If you are on a WINDOWS OS, please do the following steps :

- execute `recolte_data.sh`, it will return an error because windows can't execute python3
- execute the python script `preprocessing.py` or the notebook `preprocessing.ipynb` (it will create the datasets for the notebook `statistics.ipynb`).

You can access to the report in the file `DOZIAS_DURAND_rapport.pdf`, the link to the GitHub project is inside.
